# Train and Test Sets

Use the "Bee or Wasp?" dataset that was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jerzydziewierz/bee-vs-wasp) and slightly rebuilt.

Download the dataset from:

``` shell
    wget https://github.com/SVizor42/ML_Zoomcamp/releases/download/bee-wasp-data/data.zip
    unzip data.zip
```

The dataset contains around 2500 images of bees and around 2100 images of wasps in separate folders for training and test sets.
